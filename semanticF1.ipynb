One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.\"\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found herself surrounded by Ganon\\'s evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ... But wait! All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off Ganon\\'s henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death.\"\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    \"His name was Link. During his travels, he had come across Impa and Ganon\\'s henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of Princess Zelda and the evil Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle. If he couldn\\'t do this, there would be no chance Link could fight his way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived.\"\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Can Link really destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda?\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    \"Only your skill can answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.\"\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Gameplay\\n   \\n\\n\\n   The game itself introduces a new level of gaming, one that includes roleplaying, action, adventure, and puzzle/logic.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Dungeon\\n    \\n    Exploration\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Barring\\n   Link\\n   \\'s progress are\\n   Creatures\\n   he must battle to locate the entrances to nine underground\\n   Dungeons\\n   . Each\\n   \\n    Dungeon\\n   \\n   is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages and guarded by monsters different from those found on the\\n   Overworld\\n   .\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   must successfully navigate each\\n   \\n    Dungeon\\n   \\n   to obtain one of the eight pieces of the\\n   Triforce of Wisdom\\n   .\\n   \\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n   also conceal useful items, such as a\\n   Boomerang\\n   for retrieving items and stunning\\n   \\n    Enemies\\n   \\n   and a\\n   Flute\\n   with magical properties. The first six\\n   \\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n   have visible entrances, but the remaining three are hidden. Except for the final\\n   \\n    Dungeon\\n   \\n   , which can\\'t be entered until the previous eight have been completed, the order of completing\\n   \\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n   is somewhat arbitrary, but many\\n   \\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n   can only be reached using items gained in the previous one.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Overworld\\n    \\n    Exploration\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Non-linearity, the ability to take different paths to complete the game, separated\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   from its contemporaries.\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   can freely wander the\\n   \\n    Overworld\\n   \\n   , finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game; for example, it\\'s possible to reach the\\n   final Boss\\n   of\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   (but not defeat him) without taking a\\n   Sword\\n   . Nintendo of America\\'s management initially feared that players might become frustrated with the new concept, left wondering what to do next. As a result, the American version of the game\\'s manual contains many hints, tips, and suggestions for players.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Second Quest\\n   \\n\\n\\n   After completing the game, the player has access to a more difficult quest, officially referred to as the\\n   \\n    Second Quest\\n   \\n   , where\\n   \\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n   and the placement of items are different, with\\n   \\n    Enemies\\n   \\n   stronger. Although a more difficult \"replay\" wasn\\'t unique to\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   , few games offered a \"second quest\" with entirely different levels to complete. Entering \"ZELDA\" as the player\\'s name starts the\\n   \\n    Second Quest\\n   \\n   immediately.\\n   The\\n   \\n    Second Quest\\n   \\n   can be replayed each time it\\'s completed.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Game Information\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Development\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Shortly before starting development for\\n   \\n\\n     Super Mario Bros.\\n    \\n\\n   ,\\n   \\n    Shigeru Miyamoto\\n   \\n   began developing\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   as a launch title for the\\n   Famicom\\n   Disk System.\\n   Miyamoto got inspiration from his own explorations to the countryside and hillsides around his home for an adventure game.\\n   Seeking to create a fairytale setting, co-developer\\n   \\n    Takashi Tezuka\\n   \\n   drew inspiration from\\n   \\n    J. R. R. Tolkien\\'s\\n   \\n\\n\\n     Lord of the Rings\\n    \\n\\n   novels when writing the story.\\n   With the\\n   \\n    medieval\\n   \\n   sword and sorcery theme set, Miyamoto wanted to have treasure hunting gameplay to also bring in the sense of adventure seen in movies such as\\n   \\n\\n     Indiana Jones\\n    \\n\\n   .\\n   The game began as a two player dungeon creator, but later became a one-player game with underground dungeons that surrounded\\n   \\n    Death Mountain\\n   \\n   , with forests, lakes, and\\n   \\n    Hyrule Field\\n   \\n   added eventually as they wanted to explore aboveground too. Miyamoto wanted to call the game\\n   \\n    The Legend of\\n   \\n   something, so a PR planner suggested\\n   \\n    Zelda\\n   \\n   , the name of\\n   \\n    F. Scott Fitzgerald\\n   \\n   \\'s wife.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Japanese Version\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   was originally released in 1986 as a flagship title for the\\n   Famicom Disk System\\n   in Japan. Apart from facilitating data saving, the disk drive also added an extra sound channel on top of the Famicom\\'s original five. This has caused the original release to sport a quite different sound compared to the more widespread cartridge release. This difference is most notable during the title screen.\\n  \\n\\n   The\\n   Book of Magic\\n   is known as the\\n   \\n    Bible\\n   \\n   in the Japanese version of the game. This was likely changed because it violated Nintendo of America\\'s, at the time, very strict content guidelines which among others disapproved of any religious content or references inside games released for their systems. Interestingly enough, all depictions of the cross were kept intact.\\n  \\n\\n   The Japanese Famicom Disk System version was included in a promotional package of Charumera-brand ramen, and was only given out as a prize for a contest. It is unknown what differences this version has compared to the original release, as the only available copies are incredibly expensive.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Graphics and Audio\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Being a game designed for storage in a floppy disk, the game\\'s graphics do not use too many elements; sprites are given different color palettes depending on their location in the overworld. For example, trees can be colored either green or orange; brick walls in dungeons are painted blue, green, yellow or white, and so on.\\n  \\n\\n   The game features three background themes: the overworld tune, the standard dungeon tune and the final dungeon tune. The first theme has become the franchise\\'s main theme, and it is often reused in other games in the franchise. The dungeon theme is used as the theme for the\\n   Royal Crypt\\n   in\\n   \\n\\n     The Minish Cap\\n    \\n\\n   and in the\\n   \\n    Color Dungeon\\n   \\n   in\\n   \\n\\n     Link\\'s Awakening DX\\n    \\n\\n   . Sound samples such as the one when Link collects a new item and the one when a new path is open are also often reused in later\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   games.\\n  \\n\\n   The Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game utilizes the Disk System\\'s additional frequency-modulation synthesis chip; the music sounds more lifelike as a result.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Setting\\n   \\n\\n\\n   With this game being the first in the franchise, it is the first time\\n   \\n    Hyrule\\n   \\n   is portrayed, and it is divided into numerous parts and landscapes, such as the\\n   \\n    Lost Woods\\n   \\n   ,\\n   \\n    Death Mountain\\n   \\n   , a central lake, a\\n   forest\\n   , a\\n   \\n    graveyard\\n   \\n   , and a shore; as Link walks through them, he manages to find the hidden labyrinths where the fragments of the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   are kept. It\\'s unknown whether or not the nameless regions reappeared in later games with official names.\\n  \\n\\n   Unlike most overworlds in\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   series, this incarnation of Hyrule is entirely explorable from the beginning, meaning that Link can go to almost any corner and space of it, with a total absence of linearity. It should be noted that the overworld remains largely unchanged in the\\n   \\n    Second Quest\\n   \\n   , with the only changes being the locations of the labyrinths and of special prizes.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Timeline Placement\\n   \\n\\n\\n   According to the\\n   \\n    timeline\\n   \\n   revealed in\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Historia\\n    \\n\\n   ,\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   takes place in the \"Downfall\" branch, which, in a whole, takes place after\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   . After\\n   \\n    Ganon\\n   \\n   is defeated in\\n   \\n\\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n\\n   ,\\n   \\n\\n     Oracle of Seasons\\n    \\n\\n   and\\n   \\n\\n     Oracle of Ages\\n    \\n\\n   and in\\n   \\n\\n     A Link Between Worlds\\n    \\n\\n   where Link and Zelda recovered the Triforce from Yuga-Ganon, Hyrule entered The Golden Era, in which the wise\\n   \\n    Hyrule monarchs\\n   \\n   used the Triforce to govern the land. After the\\n   \\n    king\\n   \\n   \\'s death and the attempt of the\\n   \\n    Prince of Hyrule\\n   \\n   to assemble the complete Triforce, Hyrule was lead into the \\'Era of Decline\\'. The Prince of Darkness, Ganon was revived, leading to the events of\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   . Six years later, the events of\\n   \\n    The Adventure of Link\\n   \\n   take place.\\n  \\n\\n   Both this game and its sequel are linked in continuity, since the first game revolves around retrieving two of the major fragments of the Triforce, and Ganon is fought in order to rescue\\n   \\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   ; the second game revolves around finding the third major fragment in order to revive an incarnation of Zelda that was comatose for a very long time, and to impede the revival of Ganon.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Mistranslations\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   is littered with mistranslations, direct word-for-word translations, and odd quotes.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The intro story is written poorly, such as stating the Triforce piece Ganon stole is the \"Triforce with power\", instead of\\n    \\n     Triforce of Power\\n    \\n    . For the GBA and Wii Virtual Console ports, the message was entirely rewritten.\\n   \\n\\n    This is the first\\n    \\n     Zelda\\n    \\n    game in which Ganon is written as\\n    \\n     Gannon\\n    \\n    . This spelling was also used in the Famicom Disk System version of\\n    \\n     The Adventure of Link\\n    \\n    and in the Super Famicom release of\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    The Old Man is well known for his vagueness in messages. One of his most famous quotations is \"DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE\", indicating the\\n    \\n     Dodongo\\n    \\n    \\'s weakness to\\n    \\n     bombs\\n    \\n    . Another odd quote is \"DIGDOGGER HATES CERTAIN KINDS OF SOUND\".\\n   \\n\\n    The list of items is titled \"all of treasures\". The \"of\" was omitted in subsequent re-releases.\\n   \\n\\n    When Link pays the\\n    \\n     Old Woman\\n    \\n    behind the waterfall, she will tell him to \"Go up, up, the mountaintop.\" This was corrected to saying, \"Go up, up, the mountain ahead\". This refers to the path to\\n    Level 5\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Credits\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In the\\n   credits\\n   , all but the executive producer\\n   \\n    Hiroshi Yamauchi\\n   \\n   are listed under pseudonyms. Designer\\n   \\n    Takashi Tezuka\\n   \\n   is credited as \"Ten Ten,\" sound composer\\n   \\n    Koji Kondo\\n   \\n   as \"Konchan,\" programmer I. Marui as \"Marumaru.\" At the time, nicknames were commonly used among Japanese game developers as a company measure against employee poaching.\\n  \\n\\n   Producer and director\\n   \\n    Shigeru Miyamoto\\n   \\n   is listed as \"S. Miyahon,\" a mistranscription of his name — 本 can be read as either \"moto\" or \"hon.\"\\n   This is widely believed to be another error in translation. However, in a leaked prototype of the game, many of the staff — including Miyamoto — were credited under their real names.\\n   The pseudonym \"Miyahon\" was thus chosen deliberately for the final release.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Completion Records\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Time\\n     \\n\\n      Performer\\n     \\n\\n      Date\\n     \\n\\n      Notes\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Any%\\n     \\n\\n      Schicksal\\n     \\n\\n      27m 21s\\n     \\n\\n      July 25, 2021\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Any%\\n      \\n       (All Glitches Except Up + A)\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Schicksal\\n     \\n\\n      27m 54s\\n     \\n\\n      January 6, 2021\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      100%\\n     \\n\\n      Schicksal\\n     \\n\\n      34m 2s\\n     \\n\\n      April 27, 2021\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      100%\\n      \\n       (All Glitches Except Up + A)\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Greenmario\\n     \\n\\n      35m 18s\\n     \\n\\n      April 29, 2021\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Low%\\n      \\n\\n\\n      lackattack\\n     \\n\\n      31m 31s\\n     \\n\\n      May 14, 2019\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Sword\\n      -less\\n     \\n\\n      lackattack\\n     \\n\\n      32m 26s\\n     \\n\\n      May 12, 2019\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Extreme Rules\\n     \\n\\n      lackattack\\n     \\n\\n      1h 25m 24s\\n     \\n\\n      September 27, 2015\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Any%\\n      \\n       (\\n       Second Quest\\n       )\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Eunos\\n     \\n\\n      2m 19s\\n     \\n\\n      February 3, 2021\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Any%\\n      \\n       (\\n       \\n        Second Quest\\n       \\n       , No ACE)\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Schicksal\\n     \\n\\n      30m 38s\\n     \\n\\n      May 26, 2021\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Any%\\n      \\n       (\\n       \\n        Second Quest\\n       \\n       , No ACE or Up + A Glitch)\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Schicksal\\n     \\n\\n      33m 50s\\n     \\n\\n      February 19, 2020\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      100%\\n      \\n       (\\n       \\n        Second Quest\\n       \\n       )\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Schicksal\\n     \\n\\n      41m 38s\\n     \\n\\n      March 14, 2020\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Low%\\n      \\n       (\\n       \\n        Second Quest\\n       \\n       )\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Antlerz\\n     \\n\\n      42m 30s\\n     \\n\\n      October 16, 2020\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Sword\\n      \\n      -less\\n      \\n       (\\n       \\n        Second Quest\\n       \\n       )\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Saver\\n     \\n\\n      37m 19s\\n     \\n\\n      June 9, 2019\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Extreme Rules\\n      \\n       (\\n       \\n        Second Quest\\n       \\n       )\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Eunos\\n     \\n\\n      2h 2m 53s\\n     \\n\\n      February 25, 2016\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Listings\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Characters\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Bosses\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Enemies\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Dungeons\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Items\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Credits\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Glitches\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Reception\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Sales\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   was commercially successful, selling a million copies nearly a year after its release,\\n   and cumulating a total of 6.5 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling\\n   Nintendo Entertainment System\\n   game of all time.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Reviews\\n   \\n\\n\\n   IGN journalist Craig Harris awarded the\\n   Game Boy Advance\\n   version of the game with an 8.0 out of 10, praising its faithful adaptation from the original version;\\n   Damien McFerran from Nintendolife gave the Virtual Console version (Wii) the same score, praising the length and the complexity of the quest.\\n   Nintendojo staff, when reviewing the GCN edition (\\n   \\n\\n     Collector\\'s Edition\\n    \\n\\n   ) praised the game for its \"innovative and unique gameplay system, remarkably deep puzzle solving, and an epic score\".\\n   Nintendo Power, in the December 2009 issue, placed the game\\n   \\n    third\\n   \\n   in the list of best\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   games, citing its influence on gaming industry and praising its gameplay.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Fan Reception\\n   \\n\\n\\n   The game received support from the player community as well. It currently holds an average user score of 9.1 at GameSpot,\\n   as well as a current average reader score of 9.1 at IGN.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Ports and Remakes\\n   \\n\\n\\n   A remake of the original game,\\n   \\n\\n     BS The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n\\n   , was broadcast via the\\n   BS-X Broadcasting System\\n   . The gameplay is similar to the original, but differs as the game\\'s central heroes are the\\n   mascot characters\\n   of the BS-X Broadcasting System, who are otherwise supposed to be based on the player as the character\\'s name and gender is associated with the broadcasting ID. Aside from the initial green tunic, the male character wears a backwards baseball cap, and the female character has long red hair.\\n  \\n\\n   In 2003, Nintendo released a bundle for the\\n   Nintendo GameCube\\n   which included the\\n   \\n\\n     Collector\\'s Edition\\n    \\n\\n   , in which\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   is playable. This version notably provided a different and more accurate translation of the game script, which was used in most subsequent ports of the game.\\n   It also included a few other changes, such as reduced screen flashing.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Animal Crossing\\n    \\n\\n   , also released in 2003, includes a number of emulated NES games as furniture pieces, though some are inaccessible without a cheating device.\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   is one such unobtainable game.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   saw a port on the\\n   Game Boy Advance\\n   as part of the \"Classic NES Series\" re-releases in 2004.\\n  \\n\\n   Ports of\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   were released on the Virtual Console service for the\\n   \\n    Wii\\n   \\n   ,\\n   Nintendo 3DS\\n   , and the\\n   \\n    Wii U\\n   \\n   . The Wii Virtual Console port was released in 2006 in most regions, releasing alongside the launch of the service. The 3DS Virutual port was initially available on August 31, 2011, as one of the games eligible for free download as part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program, a service available to players who bought a 3DS before its price dropped on August 11, 2011.\\n   It was later released to the public in 2012 in most regions. The Wii U Virtual Console port was released in 2013. Nearly all Virtual Console ports uses the updated changes from the 2003\\n   \\n    Collector\\'s Edition\\n   \\n   version, with the exception of the 3DS Virtual Console port, which instead uses the original game\\'s script.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Super Smash Bros. Brawl\\n    \\n\\n   features a number of timed, short demos of classic games, called \"Masterpieces\", in which players may only play up to a certain number of minutes depending on the game.\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   is offered as one of the Masterpieces, and is limited to two minutes of gameplay time. It returns as part of the Masterpieces library of\\n   \\n\\n     Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\\n    \\n\\n   ,  where the playtime for the demo has been doubled to four minutes.\\n  \\n\\n   The\\n   \\n    NES Classic Edition\\n   \\n   includes\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   as one of the 30 games available.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online\\n   \\n   software, available to Nintendo Switch Online Subscribers, included\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   as one of its 20 launch titles. Later on during the platform\\'s life, a \"special save data\" for the game was introduced, titled \"The Legend of Zelda™ Living the life of luxury!\", that starts the game with more items and rupees in the players\\' possession.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Legacy\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   is the first installment in the\\n   \\n    Zelda\\n   \\n   franchise, and its success allowed the development of sequels. In one or another way, nearly every title in the series is influenced by this game in such ways as:\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The distinction between an overworld and a dungeon, as well as the need of traveling across the former to enter the latter, and to clear the latter to take a further step to the game\\'s completion.\\n   \\n\\n    The use of items to progress on the adventure, be it to beat enemies more easily or to open new ways and solve puzzles.\\n   \\n\\n    The introduction of Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon.\\n   \\n\\n    The introduction of the first two fragments of the\\n    \\n     Triforce\\n    \\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    The introduction of a number of recurring locations (e.g.\\n    \\n     Lost Woods\\n    \\n    and\\n    \\n     Death Mountain\\n    \\n    ) and items.\\n   \\n\\n    The presence of a\\n    \\n     Second Quest\\n    \\n    (although very few subsequent games reused this concept).\\n   \\n\\n\\n   The\\n   \\n    Moblin\\n   \\n   \\'s quote\\n   \"It\\'s a secret to everybody\"\\n   has become a popular\\n   \\n    meme\\n   \\n   among gamers over the years. It is first referenced in\\n   \\n\\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n\\n   when Link brings a chest to a man who stands next to a sign outside of the desert. He offers to open the chest under the condition that Link will \"keep it secret from everyone else\". It is also referenced in\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   . If Link bribes the guard at the gate of Hyrule Castle, speaking after he opens the gate will result in him saying \"KEEP IT A SECRET TO EVERYBODY.\" And in\\n   \\n\\n     Majora\\'s Mask\\n    \\n\\n   , after talking to Kafei in his home behind the\\n   \\n    Curiosity Shop\\n   \\n   , he says \"Keep what we just talked about a secret from everybody\". It is even referenced in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   when in\\n   \\n    Center Castle Town\\n   \\n   , Link can enter a door and walk up to a balcony, where a\\n   \\n    Goron\\n   \\n   sees the golden force around\\n   \\n    Hyrule Castle\\n   \\n   . He admits that he has kept it \"a secret to everybody.\"\\n  \\n\\n   The title theme for the game would later be used for the main theme of the game\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Warriors\\n    \\n\\n   , with bars from it also being used in the track \"Eclipse of the World\".\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Trivia\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     The Hyrule Fantasy\\n    \\n    was used as a subtitle for the Japanese version of\\n    \\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n    ; however, this was dropped in subsequent games as adding a third subtitle (such as\\n    \\n     A Link to the Past\\n    \\n    ) would have made the title too long. This choice was also made to avoid comparisons with\\n    \\n\\n      Final Fantasy\\n     \\n\\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    During development of the game, a rearrangement of\\n    \\n     Maurice Ravel\\n    \\n    \\'s\\n    \\n     Boléro\\n    \\n    by\\n    \\n     Koji Kondo\\n    \\n    was used as the title theme. However, shortly before finishing the game, the developers learned that the song was still under copyright. Since they could not delay the release of the Disk System and the game itself, Kondo wrote the actual title theme in a single night.\\n   \\n\\n    Most\\n    \\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n    cartridges are gold, but the Classic Series version of the game came in standard grey cartridges.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Names in Other Regions\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Language\\n     \\n\\n      Name\\n     \\n\\n      Meaning\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Japanese\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n       THE HYRULE FANTASY ゼルダの伝説\\n      \\n\\n       ゼルダの伝説\\n      \\n\\n\\n      The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda\\n      The Legend of Zelda\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Chinese\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n       塞尔达传说\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Zelda Legend\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Chinese\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n       薩爾達傳說\\n      \\n\\n\\n      Zelda Legend\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       German\\n      \\n\\n\\n      The Legend of Zelda\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       Korean\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n       젤다의 전설\\n      \\n\\n\\n      The Legend of Zelda\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      This article is a short summary of Eiji Aonuma.\\n      NintendoWiki features\\n      \\n       a more in-depth article\\n      \\n      .\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Eiji Aonuma\\n      青沼 英二\\n      あおぬま えいじ\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n      Current Position\\n     \\n\\n\\n       Producer of\\n       \\n\\n         The Legend of Zelda\\n        \\n        series\\n       \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Gender\\n     \\n\\n\\n       Male\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Birthday\\n     \\n\\n\\n       March 16, 1963\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Birthplace\\n     \\n\\n\\n       Nagano Prefecture, Japan\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Eiji Aonuma\\n   \\n   is a video game designer, director, and producer.

\\n\\n     Skyward Sword\\n    \\n\\n   , where she is portrayed as an ordinary girl before the kingdom of Hyrule had been established. She is always either a child, teen, or young adult. Her hair color is depicted as blonde in most games of the series, as well as brown in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   and red in\\n   \\n\\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n\\n   and\\n   \\n\\n     The Adventure of Link\\n    \\n\\n   . Her eyes are portrayed in different shades of blue throughout all the games, with the exception of her green eyes in\\n   \\n\\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n   . Her ears are always pointed, as is characteristic of all\\n   \\n    Hylians\\n   \\n   , although in some games her ears are shorter than in others. The dresses that she wears are long with determinate colors, such as different tones of pink, white, and blue. Most of her dresses are shown with the\\n   Hylian Crest\\n   , and in almost every game, she is seen wearing a tiara with either a red, pink, or blue jewel in it. In some games, she also wears long gloves. Princess Zelda is seen wearing makeup in most games, such as in\\n   \\n\\n     The Wind Waker\\n    \\n\\n   and\\n   \\n\\n     Spirit Tracks\\n    \\n\\n   , and her hairstyle is characterized either with her hair down or with braids. She wears high heels, although in\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   ,\\n   \\n    Skyward Sword\\n   \\n   , and\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   she wears boots. She also occasionally wears sandals, such as in\\n   \\n    Skyward Sword\\n   \\n   and\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   . Each incarnation of Zelda has been shown at various ages depending on which title they appear in. They have appeared as a child, a teenager and as a young adult; for example, the Princess Zelda in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   is around 20 years of age.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Personality\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Zelda is depicted as a kind and benevolent ruler with a wisdom beyond her years and a deep love towards the people she watches over. She is a caring, gracious, and self-sacrificing person.\\n   Zelda\\'s most prominent display of compassion and selflessness was when she saved the life of\\n   \\n    Midna\\n   \\n   , the Princess of the\\n   \\n    Twilight Realm\\n   \\n   , who had been nearly killed by the false King of the Twilight,\\n   \\n    Zant\\n   \\n   .\\n   Zelda\\'s wisdom is her most valuable attribute. As a matriarch, it is imperative that she makes the wisest decision concerning the fate of Hyrule; in\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   when Zant threatened her life and the lives of all of her subjects, she wisely surrendered to him.\\n   She upholds her responsibilities no matter the cost and is always willing to help her friends, such as in\\n   \\n\\n     Skyward Sword\\n    \\n\\n   , where Zelda faces her duties as the goddess reborn and willingly remains in a deep sleep to keep\\n   \\n    Demise\\n   \\n   imprisoned within his seal.\\n   Above all, Zelda is known to be a forgiving person even towards those who have harmed her before, as seen in\\n   \\n\\n     Spirit Tracks\\n    \\n\\n   , where she asks\\n   \\n    Anjean\\n   \\n   to take care of\\n   Byrne\\n   even though he was the one who stole her body.\\n  \\n\\n   Princess Zelda is one of the three most important characters of\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   series, which is also why her name appears in the title of every game. Princess Zelda first appeared in the original\\n   \\n\\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n\\n   , and has since been featured in every subsequent game, with the exception of\\n   \\n\\n     Link\\'s Awakening\\n    \\n\\n   . Each incarnation of the Princess is chosen by destiny to be the keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom in their respective eras, which is the main reason why they play such an integral role in the legends of Hyrule.\\n  \\n\\n   by the way, In Game Book \"\\n   Battle of Mirage Castle\\n   \", it is nighttime and you will take the place of Link who is trapped in the Crystal Moon, but only Link can enter the Mirage Castle.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Abilities\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Throughout the series, Princess Zelda portrays various types of both magical and physical abilities, ranging from capably wielding a bow\\n   to telepathy, as seen in\\n   \\n    A Link to the Past\\'\\n   \\n   s introduction when she pleads for Link\\'s help.\\n  \\n\\n   Early on in the\\n   \\n    timeline of the series\\n   \\n   , the original Zelda, while born as a Hylian, is the mortal incarnation of the\\n   \\n    Goddess Hylia\\n   \\n   .\\n   Carrying on this divine blood, her female descendants are always the\\n   \\n    crown princess\\n   \\n   of\\n   \\n    Hyrule\\n   \\n   throughout its history.\\n   Several princesses within the bloodline are also the possessor of the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Wisdom\\n   \\n   , imbued with the essence of the Goddess\\n   Nayru\\n   .\\n   The essence of Nayru affords each Zelda divine wisdom, allowing them to discern the wisest decisions, especially in situations concerning the welfare of Hyrule. It grants them myriad mystical abilities, including the ability to heal others, though there is a possibility that this could also be an effect of their bloodline passing down Hylia\\'s own powers and, later, the\\n   \\n    Light Force\\n   \\n   . Each incarnation of Zelda uses their powers to keep evil in check.\\n  \\n\\n   Many of her abilities as both a Sage and the wielder of the Triforce of Wisdom are widely illustrated in\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   , one of them being that she has prophetic visions in her dreams.\\n   She also helps Link in their escape from\\n   \\n    Ganon\\'s Castle\\n   \\n   by using her powers to magically remove the barriers blocking the exits. During the final battle between Link and Ganon, Princess Zelda uses her powers to restrain the King of Evil as Link delivers the final blow.\\n   Being the seventh\\n   \\n    Sage\\n   \\n   , she is the ruler of the rest of the six Sages, and it is with her guidance that the Sages seal Ganon in the void of the\\n   Evil Realm\\n   .\\n   Finally, with her powers as a Sage, she is capable of returning Link to his original time by simply using the\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   Some of Princess Zelda\\'s physical abilities are demonstrated in games such as\\n   \\n\\n     The Wind Waker\\n    \\n\\n   ,\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   and\\n   \\n\\n     Spirit Tracks\\n    \\n\\n   . In\\n   \\n    The Wind Waker\\n   \\n   , Princess Zelda aids Link in battling Ganondorf by borrowing the young hero\\'s bow and using it to fire\\n   Light Arrows\\n   at the King of the Gerudo.\\n   This skill is again portrayed in the final battle of\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   , where the princess yet again uses a bow and Light Arrows to strike Ganondorf while accompanying Link on his horse,\\n   and once more in the final battle against\\n   \\n    Malladus\\n   \\n   in\\n   \\n    Spirit Tracks\\n   \\n   . In one scene of\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   , Princess Zelda is seen wielding a sword, although it is unknown if she possesses any true sword skills.\\n  \\n\\n   As shown in\\n   \\n    Twilight Princess\\n   \\n   , Princess Zelda is capable of communicating with the\\n   Light Spirits\\n   . Just as the princess and Link are about to be trampled by Ganondorf\\'s ghostly army, Zelda calls upon the Light Spirits to aid her in her time of need, and the spirits grant her the Light Arrow to banish evil.\\n  \\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Spirit Tracks\\n   \\n   , Princess Zelda can possess a\\n   Phantom\\n   \\'s body after Link strikes it with a powered-up sword or the\\n   Lokomo Sword\\n   . While in this state, the princess can help Link solve various puzzles as well as cross certain obstacles that the young hero cannot traverse by himself.\\n   Moreover, due to the Phantom\\'s armor, she can also protect Link from attacks or use her strength to fight alongside Link and help him defeat enemies, as seen when fighting\\n   Geozards\\n   or\\n   Byrne\\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   In the Game Book \"Battle of Mirage Castle\", it has the same abilities as Link.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Naming Tradition and Law\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Origin\\n   \\n\\n\\n   It was revealed by\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Historia\\n    \\n\\n   that when the kingdom of Hyrule was established during the\\n   Era of Prosperity\\n   , the daughters of the Royal Family were often named Zelda after their ancestor, the\\n   mortal incarnation of the Goddess Hylia\\n   , from the events of\\n   \\n    Skyward Sword\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    The Tragedy of \"Princess Zelda I\"\\n   \\n\\n\\n   While she was not the first Princess Zelda in the history of Hyrule, she was the first in a long line of princesses to be named Zelda by law and not tradition after she was put into a deep sleep for many generations. Her brother, the\\n   \\n    Prince of Hyrule\\n   \\n   at the end of its\\n   Golden Era\\n   , who was partly to blame for her comatose state, decided that, in honor of his sister, every princess born into the\\n   \\n    Royal Family of Hyrule\\n   \\n   should be named Zelda.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Unified Timeline\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Skyward Sword\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   The Zelda in\\n   \\n\\n     Skyward Sword\\n    \\n\\n   is the eleventh Zelda appearing in the\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   series, and is currently the earliest incarnation of Zelda chronologically to appear in-game.\\n  \\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Skyward Sword\\n   \\n   , Zelda, daughter of\\n   Gaepora\\n   , lives in\\n   \\n    Skyloft\\n   \\n   with her childhood friend\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   ,\\n   where they are both students at the\\n   Knight Academy\\n   .\\n   After playing the role of the\\n   \\n    goddess\\n   \\n   at the\\n   \\n    Wing Ceremony\\n   \\n   , Link and Zelda go for a flight together, when suddenly a twister pulls Zelda and her\\n   \\n    Loftwing\\n   \\n   below the clouds. This phenomenon is later revealed to have been caused by\\n   \\n    Ghirahim\\n   \\n   , who needs Zelda\\'s soul to resurrect\\n   \\n    Demise\\n   \\n   , his master.\\n   Upon Zelda\\'s arrival on\\n   \\n    the Surface\\n   \\n   , however, she is rescued by\\n   \\n    Impa\\n   \\n   before the Demon Lord can capture her.\\n   Link then begins to look for Zelda and eventually finds her in the\\n   Earth Spring\\n   , but Impa impedes him from reaching the young girl,\\n   and instead urges Zelda to continue praying at each goddess statue to finish purifying her body.\\n  \\n\\n   Eventually, Link catches up with Zelda and Impa at the\\n   \\n    Temple of Time\\n   \\n   , but their reunion is cut short when Ghirahim attacks the duo. In the midst of the frenetic action, Zelda gives Link the\\n   \\n    Goddess\\'s Harp\\n   \\n   before she and Impa escape through the\\n   \\n    Gate of Time\\n   \\n   , with Impa destroying the gate to escape Ghirahim\\'s grasp. Link manages to activate a second Gate of Time and meets with Zelda, who explains her true nature as the mortal reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia before telling Link that she,\\n   as Hylia reborn, must remain in a deep sleep to keep Demise imprisoned within his seal.\\n   Before doing so, Zelda explains that the goddess needed someone with an \"unbreakable spirit\" to defeat Demise.\\n   However, Hylia, knowing that the young hero would \"throw [himself] headfirst into any danger, without even a moment\\'s doubt\" if it meant saving Zelda,\\n   used Link to try and bring about the destruction of Demise. She proceeds to seal herself into a crystal and sleep for thousands of years to ensure Demise\\'s seal holds, and tells Link that he must find and use the Triforce to destroy Demise so that she will be able to wake up in their own time.\\n  \\n\\n   Although Link uses the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   to wish for Demise\\'s destruction,\\n   \\n    Ghirahim\\n   \\n   kidnaps Zelda upon her awakening and takes her through the Gate of Time, where Demise is still sealed.\\n   Zelda\\'s soul is absorbed and Demise is revived in his true form,\\n   but Link manages to defeat the Demon King and seal his remains in the\\n   \\n    Master Sword\\n   \\n   . After her soul is restored, Zelda and the young hero return to their own time, where she mentions to Link that she wants to remain in the surface and watch over the Triforce. Zelda asks what Link\\'s intentions are for the future,\\n   and Link smiles at her, with the camera panning to show both his and Zelda\\'s Loftwings flying back into the sky, implying that Link chose to stay with Zelda.\\n  \\n\\n   This incarnation of Zelda is unique in that she is not a princess during the course of the game\\'s events.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Fi\\n    \\n    \\'s Comment:\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n         Target Lock:\\n        \\n\\n         Zelda\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n       This is\\n       \\n        Zelda\\n       \\n       , your childhood friend.

This changed when a young\\n   \\n    Kokiri\\n   \\n   boy named Link snuck into her garden courtyard.\\n  \\n\\n   Convinced that Ganondorf was after the Triforce, Zelda asked Link to find the three Spiritual Stones that would open the\\n   \\n    Temple of Time\\n   \\n   in order to prevent Ganondorf from opening the Door of Time and claiming the Triforce for himself.\\n   Unfortunately, Ganondorf made his move before Link could return, leading an insurrection in the castle.

One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla\\'s hideout. Confused by the youth\\'s unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light. Zelda then sets of for Hyrule Castle before sending Aginah to find the Book of Mudora while she speaks to the Fortune Teller. Aginah and the hero travel to the Sanctuary at the foot of the mountain, but Zelda follows, claiming she had another prophetic dream, this time of her holding the Book of Mudora on top of Death Mountain. Zelda insists on traveling with the hero to the summit of the mountain, as she is the only one who can read the Book of Mudora. During their quest to obtain the final two tablets and reach the summit, the Fortune Teller sees the King of Evil in a vision. Ganon\\'s malice had kept his spirit alive despite the destruction of his body. It was this lingering evil power that had drawn the Hero of Light into the land of Hyrule, and upon the summit the hero travels once more into another world to engage in a desperate final battle with the Demon King in a new version of Ganon\\'s Tower.

Afterward, Link, Zelda, and\\n   \\n    Alfonzo\\n   \\n   attempt to escape via train, but the train crashes due to the\\n   \\n    tracks\\n   \\n   disappearing beneath them.\\n   Chancellor Cole\\n   then appears to attack Zelda and take her body, which he hopes to use to revive the Demon King\\n   \\n    Malladus\\n   \\n   ; however, Zelda\\'s spirit escapes and returns to Hyrule Castle. There, she meets with Link, now the only one who can see her, to continue their way to the Tower of Spirits, where Zelda learns she can\\n   inhabit Phantoms\\n   to aid Link. After this, she and Link begin their journey to restore the Spirit Tracks leading to the Tower of Spirits to fortify the Malladus\\'s prison and thus prevent the resurrection of the Demon King.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n     Zelda as a ghost in\\n     \\n      Spirit Tracks\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Zelda\\'s body is eventually possessed by the resurrected Malladus, although Link frees it by firing a\\n   Light Arrow\\n   . Despite this, Zelda is unable to reenter her body, and just as Malladus is about to possess it again, Byrne uses his power to repel the Demon King, giving Zelda the strength to pray to her grandmother Tetra to reclaim her body.\\n    In the final battle, Zelda, finally back in her own body, charges up her power to weaken the Demon King, which reveals a weak spot on the demon\\'s back.\\n    Like in previous games, Princess Zelda\\'s role consists of shooting Light Arrows at Malladus\\'s back from the\\n   Bow of Light\\n   .\\n    Just as Link realizes that he cannot make the final blow to Malladus using the\\n   Lokomo Sword\\n   on his own, Princess Zelda rushes over to help the young hero, defeating the demon once and for all.\\n    Anjean and the rest of the Lokomos depart to the heavens, entrusting Link and Zelda to watch over the land for them.\\n    Link and Zelda are then seen holding hands as they witness the departure of the Lokomos.\\n  \\n\\n   After the ending credits, Princess Zelda can be seen at her office signing papers and, depending on whether Link chose to be an engineer or a warrior, she will go look out the window and wave at Link upon hearing either a train whistle or swords clanking. If Link selects \"Dunno\", then Zelda will be signing papers and simply remember the adventure she had with Link.\\n  \\n\\n   This Princess Zelda is confirmed to be a direct descendant of\\n   \\n    Tetra\\n   \\n   ,\\n    the pirate captain who was also the incarnation of Princess Zelda in her day, and makes an appearance in a large stained glass window in Hyrule Castle\\'s Throne Room.\\n    Princess Zelda states that the\\n   \\n    Spirit Flute\\n   \\n   was played for her in her youth by her grandmother, and Anjean states that she gave the Spirit Flute to Tetra long ago, pointing out the similarities between the reigning Princess Zelda and her ancestor, the feisty pirate captain that arrived on the land\\'s shores long ago.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Great Calamity\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n     Artwork of Zelda from\\n     \\n      The Champions\\' Ballad\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   , Zelda is not only the princess of Hyrule, she is also an aspiring scholar who is very curious.\\n    She is also the leader of the\\n   \\n    Champions\\n   \\n   of Hyrule.\\n    Zelda is the mysterious voice that guides Link throughout his journey while she contains Calamity Ganon inside of Hyrule Castle.\\n  \\n\\n   Zelda has been training to unlock her sealing powers passed down the royal family since she was 7 years old, one year after her mother unexpectedly passed away. With her mother gone there was nobody else around with the sacred power who could teach her how to use it, leaving Zelda to figure it out on her own.\\n    100 years prior to the events of\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   , Zelda met with the Champions. After meeting with them, she left the Castle to research ancient technology, but she did not come across anything of note.\\n    During this time, she felt the presence of Ganon and devoted herself to learning all she could about ancient relics in order to stop him.\\n    She then met with a fortune teller who told her a prophecy, to which Zelda felt that there was not much time left.\\n    The following day, Link was appointed as Zelda\\'s knight, to Zelda\\'s chagrin.\\n    During the ceremony, Urbosa explains that Link is a living reminder of Zelda\\'s own failures.\\n    Link and Zelda then set out to\\n   \\n    Goron City\\n   \\n   to make adjustments to the\\n   Divine Beast Vah Rudania\\n   to make it easier for\\n   Daruk\\n   to control.\\n    During their journey to\\n   Eldin\\n   , Zelda comes to a stop and asks him how proficient he is wielding his\\n   \\n    Sword\\n   \\n   and asks him if he can hear the voice within the blade.\\n  \\n\\n   During her time with Link, Zelda wonders why he never speaks.\\n    Link\\'s initial silence causes Zelda to believe that Link despised her due to her inability to use sealing power despite being a daughter of Hyrule\\'s royal family.\\n    Later on, Zelda discovers an\\n   \\n    Ancient Shrine\\n   \\n   and fails to open it.\\n    Link arrives at the scene, which angers Zelda and causes her to lash out.\\n    She tells Link to return to the castle\\n    and testily demands he stop following her, regardless of the\\n   \\n    King\\n   \\n   \\'s orders.\\n    Later on, Zelda travels to the\\n   \\n    Gerudo Desert\\n   \\n   and is ambushed by the\\n   Yiga Clan\\n   . Link rescues her right before a\\n   Yiga assassin\\n   is about to kill her, striking him down and causing the other two Yiga to flee. This causes Zelda to change her attitude towards Link, valuing his devotion to protect her.\\n    Over the course of their journey, both start to open up to each other and realize how similar they are in their hardships of fulfilling their respective tasks.\\n    Her growing care and relationship towards Link plays a crucial role in awakening her\\n   \\n    legendary abilities\\n   \\n   , as Link sacrifices himself to save Zelda\\'s life during the\\n   second Great Calamity\\n   and Zelda\\'s powers awaken when she tries to rescue the wounded Link from a Guardian.\\n    Zelda then spends the next 100 years inside Hyrule Castle with Calamity Ganon, keeping the demon in place within the Castle to prevent the destruction of the entirety of Hyrule. After Link awakens, she then telepathically guides him throughout his journey. Unfortunately, she was not able to hold off Calamity Ganon for much longer before he developed a rudimentary body. After Link managed to disable Calamity Ganon\\'s most powerful form, Dark Beast Ganon, she was freed, and proceeded to destroy Calamity Ganon\\'s essence. She then reconvened with Link for the first time in a hundred years, and asked him if he still remembered her (as Link was initially left with amnesia thanks to his near-death experience). Some time later, she alongside Link left for Lake Hylia in order to investigate what caused the Divine Beast Vah Ruta to stop working, and that they ultimately need to restore Hyrule back to its former glory.\\n  \\n\\n   Her favorite food is\\n   Fruitcake\\n   , as revealed by a recipe in a book in the Library in Hyrule Castle.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Sequel to\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Princess Zelda\\n   \\n   appears in the\\n   Sequel to\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   . Picking up where the true ending left off, Zelda alongside Link traversed through a cave, only to find\\n   \\n    a mummified Gerudo corpse\\n   \\n   with an ethereal hand touching its chest, as well as it attracting Malice. She eventually ended up separated from Link, and witnessed the corpse revive itself via the malice.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Appearances\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Princess is also featured in other media, including comics based on the games, animated shows, and the\\n   \\n    Super Smash Bros.\\n   \\n   series\\n    . In some of her appearances, she is depicted as a brave, proud, and self-reliant fighter who is proficient in archery and horseback riding, such as in the\\n   \\n    The Legend of Zelda\\n   \\n   comics\\n   by\\n   Valiant Comics\\n   and\\n   \\n\\n     The Legend of Zelda\\n    \\n    TV series\\n   \\n   . As with the games, she is the protector of the Triforce of Wisdom.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Alter Egos\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Sheik\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   , Link met up with a mysterious member of the\\n   \\n    Sheikah\\n   \\n   Tribe, fittingly called Sheik. This person taught\\n   \\n    Link\\n   \\n   a multitude of different songs and gave him tips on how to proceed in his quest. At the end of the game, Sheik revealed himself to be none other than Princess Zelda in a disguise.\\n    During the seven years Link had been asleep while maturing to become ready to fight\\n   \\n    Ganondorf\\n   \\n   , Zelda had gone underground and taken the disguise as Sheik so that Ganondorf would not find her in his search for the two remaining pieces of the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   , one which was held by Princess Zelda herself.\\n  \\n\\n   Sheik is also a playable character in\\n   \\n    Super Smash Bros. Melee\\n   \\n   and\\n   \\n    Super Smash Bros. Brawl\\n   \\n   : Zelda is able to transform into Sheik during a battle, allowing her to use a different set of moves.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Tetra\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Born into a society of pirates on the Great Sea, Tetra, captain of a\\n   \\n    crew of pirates\\n   \\n   , was completely unaware that she was a member of the Royal Family of Hyrule\\'s bloodline.\\n    When this was revealed to her by\\n   \\n    Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule\\n   \\n   , she was just as surprised as Link to find out that she was indeed a descendant of Princess Zelda of Hyrule and also the one destined to be the keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Leader of the Sages\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   , Zelda is revealed to be the seventh\\n   \\n    Sage\\n   \\n   and the leader of them all.\\n    Though no conclusive evidence has been sighted, Zelda is often seen as the proverbial\\n   Sage of Time\\n   , via several events that occur in\\n   \\n    Ocarina of Time\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Goddess Hylia\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Before the events of\\n   \\n\\n     Skyward Sword\\n    \\n\\n   , a goddess named Hylia defeated\\n   \\n    Demise\\n   \\n   . In order to protect the\\n   \\n    Triforce\\n   \\n   , in a two-part plan, Hylia renounced her divine body to reborn in an human being. This human was born eons after under the name of Zelda.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Other Princesses of Hyrule\\n   \\n\\n\\n   Besides the Princess Zeldas that appear in the games, the back story to some of the games feature additional unnamed Princesses of Hyrule who have a similar appearance to Princess Zelda.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Princess from the\\n    \\n     Minish Legend\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n   The back story of\\n   \\n\\n     The Minish Cap\\n    \\n\\n   tells of the\\n   Minish Legend\\n   . In the\\n   \\n    Minish Legend\\n   \\n   , a hero clad in green clothes, the\\n   Hero of Men\\n   arose to fight the demons attacking the world. This story of the\\n   \\n    Minish Legend\\n   \\n   is depicted in a series of stained glass windows beneath the\\n   Elemental Sanctuary\\n   . One of the stained glass windows depicts a Princess of Hyrule wielding the\\n   \\n    Light Force\\n   \\n   . Using the stained glass window,\\n   \\n    Vaati\\n   \\n   is able to deduce that the Light Force is currently held by the current Princess Zelda.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Antediluvian Princess\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     The Wind Waker\\n    \\n\\n   , when Link travels to\\n   \\n    Hyrule Castle\\n   \\n   beneath the\\n   \\n    Great Sea\\n   \\n   , there is a portrait of the Princess of Hyrule (around the age of\\n   \\n    Tetra\\n   \\n   ) from before the\\n   \\n    Great Flood\\n   \\n   hanging on the wall of the castle. In the portrait, the princess is surrounded by several characters, all of which have a counterpart to a member of\\n   \\n    Tetra\\'s Pirate Crew\\n   \\n   . It is known that during the Great Flood, she took a piece of the\\n   \\n    Triforce of Wisdom\\n   \\n   which had been broken in two by her\\n   \\n    father\\n   \\n   and fled to the mountaintops with several of her servants.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Ten Thousands Years prior to\\n    \\n\\n      Breath of the Wild\\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   Learned by\\n   \\n    Impa\\n   \\n   and\\n   Kass\\n   , the Zelda that lived ten thousand years prior to the events of\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   assisted Link and the four\\n   \\n    Champions\\n   \\n   in defending Hyrule from Calamity Ganon. Successfully defeating the Calamity, Zelda sealed Ganon away for ten thousand years, leading to his release one hundred years before the events of\\n   \\n    Breath of the Wild\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Zelda\\'s Weapons\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Bow and Arrows of Light\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In several games, starting with\\n   \\n\\n     Ocarina of Time\\n    \\n\\n   , Zelda either wields the Light Arrows or bestows them on Link, allowing him to defeat Ganon. In some cases, she is also able to summon a magical bow made from pure light in order to fire the arrows.\\n  \\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Warriors\\n    \\n\\n   , the magical bow and light arrows can be summoned as part of Zelda\\'s combos and special attacks while wielding her rapiers.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Rapier\\n   \\n\\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Twilight Princess\\n    \\n\\n   , Zelda carries an ornate rapier, seemingly as a\\n   \\n    sword of state\\n   \\n   . When possessed by\\n   \\n    Ganondorf\\n   \\n   , she also uses it as a weapon against Link.\\n  \\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Warriors\\n    \\n\\n   , this rapier is named the \"Polished Rapier\", and is one of several rapiers the princess can use, alongside the more ornate Glittering Rapier, the extravagant Gleaming Rapier, which also bears the royal crest, and the humorous 8-Bit\\n   White Sword\\n   , a joke weapon.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Baton\\n   \\n\\n\\n   While Zelda does not wield the\\n   \\n    Wind Waker\\n   \\n   in its titular introduction,\\n   \\n\\n     The Wind Waker\\n    \\n\\n   , it is claimed to be an instrument of the royal family used by the monarch in conducting the\\n   \\n    Sages\\n   \\n   .\\n  \\n\\n   In\\n   \\n\\n     Hyrule Warriors\\n    \\n\\n   , Zelda is able to use the Wind Waker to conduct magical songs that summon wind and lightning. She can also use the Sacred Baton, which resembles a crystallized gust of wind, and the Glorious Baton, which resembles a\\n   \\n    Great Fairy\\n   \\n   \\'s locks of hair.\\n  \\n\\n\\n    Trivia\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Link\\'s Awakening\\n     \\n\\n    and\\n    \\n\\n      Tri Force Heroes\\n     \\n\\n    are the only games where\\n    \\n     Princess Zelda\\n    \\n    \\'s presence is completely absent.

In it, she speaks with an English accent. It is technically also the second main series game to supply full voice acting overall, with the\\n    \\n     Navi Trackers\\n    \\n    mode for the Japanese version of\\n    \\n\\n      Four Swords Adventures\\n     \\n\\n    being the first with Zelda\\'s alter-ego\\n    \\n     Tetra\\n    \\n    .\\n   \\n\\n    What Zelda says to Link regarding his memories and courage immediately prior to the final battle with Ganon in\\n    \\n     Breath of the Wild\\n    \\n    varied between languages. In the Japanese version, Zelda states that she believes in Link and his courage regardless of whether he regained his memories,\\n     while in the English localization, she instead states that courage doesn\\'t need to be remembered due to one never forgetting the concept in the first place.\\n   \\n\\n    During the final battle with\\n    \\n     Ganon\\n    \\n    in\\n    \\n\\n      Ocarina of Time\\n     \\n\\n    and its remake\\n    \\n\\n      Ocarina of Time 3D\\n     \\n\\n    , whenever\\n    \\n     Link\\n    \\n    ends up hit by one of Ganon\\'s attacks,\\n    \\n     Princess Zelda\\n    \\n    can be heard gasping in horror.\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n    Shigeru Miyamoto\\n   \\n   stated that the Princess Zelda\\'s name originated from Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of the acclaimed author, F.
